// To use, add the item index of the taunt as the primary key.
// Then, add 0 to block or 1 to allow the taunt.
// Allowing is the default behaviour so you only need to add indexes for taunts you wish to block!
//
// Example:
//
// "1162"	"0"
//
// This will tell the plugin to block the Conga Taunt if a client is about to perform the taunt.
//
// The intention behind this is to globally block specific taunts incase of problems caused by them.
// For example, the new taunts in the Scream Fortress X update have been causing client crashes.
// So, we will block them before the client even performs the taunt so we won't have to run the risk of clients crashing.
//
// If you wish for a more specific fix for specific conditions only, then adapt (or write) a plugin to do so.
